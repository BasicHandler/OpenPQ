## OpenPQ: Post-Quantum Cryptographic Ecosystem

#CURRENTLY UNDER TEST

OpenPQ is a comprehensive library designed to protect confidential electronic information through advanced encryption algorithms. Developed using Rust's cross-platform integration, OpenPQ facilitates seamless transitioning and safety for users seeking to secure their data in a post-quantum environment. This library adheres to NIST standards and employs the Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for robust encryption.

### Modules

OpenPQ comprises several key modules, each addressing specific aspects of data security:

- **JKPQ**: This module enables secure communication tunnels by encapsulating public keys. It provides a reliable method for transmitting sensitive information over potentially insecure channels, ensuring that data in transit remains confidential and protected.

- **storagePQ**: Currently under development, this module will focus on securing data at rest. It aims to provide encryption solutions for file systems and containers, allowing users to store sensitive information safely without the risk of unauthorized access.

- **clipboardPQ**: This module facilitates the secure transport of sensitive data, allowing users to copy and paste confidential information while minimizing exposure risks.

### Features

- **Post-Quantum Security**: Utilizing the Kyber KEM, OpenPQ is designed to withstand potential threats posed by quantum computing, making it a future-proof solution for data encryption.

- **NIST Compliance**: OpenPQ adheres to the latest NIST standards, ensuring that the encryption methods employed are recognized and validated for their security.

- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Built with Rust, OpenPQ offers seamless integration across various platforms, making it accessible and easy to implement in diverse environments.

### Vision

OpenPQ aims to democratize access to NIST's Post-Quantum cryptographic standards, making advanced encryption methods available not only to large organizations with substantial budgets but also to a broader audience. This initiative seeks to ensure that robust data protection is accessible to all users, regardless of their financial resources. By providing these state-of-the-art encryption solutions, OpenPQ empowers individuals and smaller projects to secure their sensitive information effectively.
